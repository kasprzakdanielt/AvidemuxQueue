# FFMPEG Queue Tool


Easy to use, simple app with integrated ffmpeg, allowing conversion from one audio codec to another(video source is copied so there should be no quality loss). Done mainly for myself, as my TV wont play E-AC3 so I have to change it to AC3 and I couldnt find any nice tool to queue matroska files.




Still in development.
